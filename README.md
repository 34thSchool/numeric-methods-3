# Gaussian elimination

Write a (graphical) program (e.g. using ebiten) that, for a given set of points (can be generated using randomization),
approximates a set of points using a polynom of a given order. The polynom coefficient values must be found using Gaussian elimination method.

The program must draw the given points as well as the approximating polynom.
